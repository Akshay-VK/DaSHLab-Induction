Fault detection mechanism:
The program keeps a timer running for every worker which is refreshed for each when it returns a result.
If it has been more than 5 seconds since which anythin has been returned, it is considered as a faulty worker and its processes are terminated.
The batch/chunk being handles by it is marked as free and is assigned to another worker in the future

Recovery strategy:
Work statuses are kept track of using a map of integers
0 indicated pending
-1 indicates processed
(any other number) indicates the rank of the worker processing it currently

Every time a worker returns a processed chunk, those are marked as -1(completed) and a new chunk is made from the following pending files.

When a worker is terminated, the chunk handled by it is marked from its rank to 0(free).
So whenever another worker is done with its chunk and a new chunk is being assigned to it, these newly makred free files are assigned to it automatically.

Checkpointing design:
The following data is saved when a checkpoint is made:
- timestamp
- current counts
- paths of processed files
- paths of pending files

We save checkpoint data every 5 seconds and after completion of processing.

Consistency model: 
I chose eventual consistency as themathod, in integration with my way of managing state went hand in hand.
The method in which files were handed out in this method made implementing reassignment extremely trivial.
It is also much easier to keep track of, whereas in the other method, each worker handles its own state independently and makes the entire process much too cmoplicated.

Design decisions:
The most interesting design decision I made was the method of state management.
Along the with the list of files, I made a list or map of the same length.
Corresponding indices indicated the status of each file.

0  - pending
-1 - processed
any other integer  - rank of worker currently processing file

When any worker returns a value to the master and requires the next chunk of files, we go through this map and look for the ones marked 0 and assign some(chunk size) of them to the worker.

This method makes file reassignment extremely easy as we can simply change the value in the map to 0 and stop the faulty/crashed worker.
Whenever any other worker returns and requests for a chunk, these files which are now marked 0, are automatically assigned.

Limitations:
So far the only case which this program cannot handle is when the master process crashes.
