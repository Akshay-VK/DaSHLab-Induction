# Task 2: Paper Reading

## Welcome
DaSH at its core is a Computer Systems _Research_ Lab, and paper reading is one of the most important skills a researcher must hone.

Thus far, you will likely have gained your CS-related knowledge through textbooks, videos or articles/blogs. In the world of research, however, these forms of media are limited; research papers are the norm. These papers tend to be much more information-dense and comparatively difficult to unpack and understand. As such, expect this task to take a fair amount of time and conscious effort to complete well.

To give you a taste of what you will be doing basically every week should you choose to pursue research, we have designed the paper reading task. Because paper reading is an art that takes a fair amount of experience to master, don't expect to become very good at paper reading through the course of this task. By the end, you will have read your first paper, and also gained in-depth knowledge of the subdomain of the paper of your choosing.

## The Assignment: Critiquing a Paper
Choose **ONE** of the following papers to read:
- [The Google File System, Ghemawat et. al.](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf)
- [Time, Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System, Leslie Lamport](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/time-clocks.pdf)
- [Don’t be lazy, be consistent: Postgres-R, a new way to implement Database Replication, Kemme et. al.](https://www.vldb.org/conf/2000/P134.pdf)

After reading the paper, write a report on it (details [here](#deliverables)).

## Tips on Paper-Reading
- Don't read the paper in a linear fashion from top to bottom.
- Make multiple passes through the paper. In the initial passes, you only need to get a high-level overview of the paper, i.e., a broad idea of the problem that the paper is attempting to solve, and the solution approach followed.
- With each successive pass, spend more time on sections you previously weren't able to understand. Revisit these sections and try to really break down what you've read.
- Don't get overwhelmed by references. You do not need to go through all of them to understand the paper. Use an aid like an LLM to explain concepts which are new to you.

## What We're Looking For

### Deliverables

**`analysis.md`** - a file detailing your analysis and critique of the paper, containing:
- A short summary of the paper (~200 words)
- A description of the problem the paper attempts to solve (~100 words)
- A description of the core solution design of the paper (~400 words)
- A discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper (~500 words)
- Personal reflection including what you learned, how the paper relates to other concepts you know and what you would have done differently (~300 words)

### Analysis Guidelines

#### Do:
- Be specific with examples from the paper
- Support criticisms with technical reasoning
- Consider both theoretical and practical aspects
- Think about real-world deployment challenges
- Connect ideas to broader systems concepts

#### Don't:
- Just summarize without analysis
- Make vague criticisms ("not scalable" without explanation)
- Focus only on writing quality
- Ignore experimental methodology
- Accept claims without scrutiny

### Other Expectations
- Beyond the written paper review, you should also prepare yourself for an open discussion about the topics around which the paper revolves. If the paper you read was on optimisations for file systems for a specific use case, you should have some background knowledge about the functioning of file systems in general.
- Don't narrow your horizons to the text of the paper; think about how the ideas introduced in the paper can be adapted to other problems.
- Try to be objective; you are neither required to defend nor bash the paper. Try to be unbiased and critical about what you're reading.
- You don't need to memorise material from the paper, but you should work hard to understand it thoroughly.

## Closing Note
It's completely okay if you're not able to understand _everything_ that the paper talks about in depth. Try to focus on the core contributions of the paper. Paper reading is not at all an easy task, but starting off early means you're already ahead of the curve!
